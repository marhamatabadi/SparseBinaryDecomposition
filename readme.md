## Problem Description

A non-negative integer N is called sparse if its binary representation does not contain two consecutive bits set to 1. For example:

-   41 is sparse (binary: "101001")
-   26 is not sparse (binary: "11010")

The challenge is to find two non-negative integers P and Q such that:

-   P and Q are sparse.
-   N=P+Q.

### Example:

For N=26:

-   Possible decompositions include:
    -   8 (binary: "1000") and 18 (binary: "10010")
    -   9 (binary: "1001") and 17 (binary: "10001")

## Solution

This project implements an efficient algorithm in C# to find one part of the sparse decomposition of N or returns âˆ’1 if no such decomposition exists. 
**The algorithm runs in constant time O(1).**

### Function Signature

    public static int Solution(int N)
    {
        if (IsSparse(N & 0x55555555))
            return N & 0x55555555;
        else if (IsSparse(N & 0xAAAAAAA))
            return (N & 0xAAAAAAA);
        else
            return -1;
    }
    private static bool IsSparse(int x)
    {
        return (x & (x >> 1)) == 0;
    }
